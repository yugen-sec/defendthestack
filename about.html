      <h1>About DefendTheStack</h1>
      <p>
        DefendTheStack is a space that we created to share our journey of continuous learning in cyber security. Our main goal with this blog is to document what we're learning and 
        make it available for anyone who might find it useful, whether you're a beginner or already on your path in this field. <br><br>
        Our posts will cover both the offensive and defensive aspects of cybersecurity focusing on practical and real-world applicable scenarios. We know how overwhelming it can be when you
        don't know where to start, or if you're stuck in tutorial hell. That's why we want DefendTheStack to serve as a guide, showing not just what we're learning, but also our approach to
        things, so you can follow up on your own.<br><br>
        You’ll also find CTF writeups here, where we’ll write about the challenges we attempt and share the thought processes that guided us to their solutions. Alongside that, we’ll also do 
        technical deep dives to better understand the fundamentals that relates to various areas in cybersecurity.<br><br>
        Keep in mind that we're not "experts" of any kind as well. We're just two friends who are forever learners with an immense interest in hacking and securing things. If what we blog here helps
        even one person learn something new or feel less stuck, then DefendTheStack has done its job.<strong>:)</strong>

          Hi, I’m Rusiru Theshan, an information security professional with a passion for both offensive and defensive aspects of cyber security. Lately, I've also 
          been exploring the governance and risk management side of things to broaden my understanding of this field.<br><br>
          My passion for cyber security started during my university days when I was reading for my Bachelor's degree in computer networking. A friend of mine introduced me to Kali Linux 
          and HackTheBox (back when you had to hack your way in to get an invite code!). I was instantly hooked and fell down the cyber security rabbit hole that I'm still happily exploring today. <br><br>
          Since then, I’ve been fortunate to turn that curiosity into a career in cybersecurity. The continuous evolution of the industry, the need to continuously learn and unlearn,
          and the people that I've been able to network with are all the reasons that I now love what I do. It's a very challenging and humbling field, but also personally rewarding if you love it.
          Through DefendTheStack, my goal is to catalogue my learning journey and share insights with others who might find them useful. <br><br>
          Outside of cyber security, I enjoy reading books on a variety of topics, including philosophy, science, and sci-fi novels (recently realised this!). I also love boxing and have
          been doing it since college days. It's a great way to stay fit and let off some steam. And most importantly, I'm a dog dad to Aadhi and Murphy (RIP), who mean the world to me.

           I'm a cybersecurity researcher who has been strongly passionate about tech-related subjects since my teenage years. I'm an enthusiast in pentesting, phishing, and reverse engineering. I would love to be researching, finding new potholes in systems and applications, and teaching and educating the world about the cool things I find.

<br><br>potential started when I was in university. I was very poor at programming and really struggling with it. One day I clicked on a random video suggested by the YouTube algorithm. It was titled "Algorithmic Thinking," published by MIT OpenCourseWare. In that video, there was a skinny lecturer named "Dr. Srini Devdas," and I started barely putting an ear to his words. With time, I noticed that I could understand most of the things he said and kept listening.

<br><br>With that scenario, I realized I was not poor at programming or algorithms,the way I realized things was just different. That day, I wanted to gain great knowledge about what I love to do and educate people who have enthusiasm in what I’m enthusiastic about. Explore this tech universe, find cool things, and give something new to this cyber world,something remarkable.
