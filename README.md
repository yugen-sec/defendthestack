DefendTheStack is a space that we created to share our journey of continuous learning in cyber security. Our main goal with this blog is to document what we're learning and make it available for anyone who might find it useful, whether you're a beginner or already on your path in this field.

Our posts will cover both the offensive and defensive aspects of cyber security focusing on practical and real-world applicable scenarios. We know how overwhelming it can be when you don't know where to start, or if you're stuck in tutorial hell. That's why we want DefendTheStack to serve as a guide, showing not just what we're learning, but also our approach to things, so you can follow up on your own.

You’ll also find CTF writeups here, where we’ll write about the challenges we attempt and share the thought processes that guided us to their solutions. Alongside that, we’ll also do technical deep dives to better understand the fundamentals that relates to various areas in cyber security.

Keep in mind that we're not "experts" of any kind as well. We're just two friends who are forever learners with an immense interest in hacking and securing things. If what we blog here helps even one person learn something new or feel less stuck, then DefendTheStack has done its job.:)
