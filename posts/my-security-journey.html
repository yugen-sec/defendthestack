    <h1>Why I Got Into Cybersecurity</h1>
    <p class="post-meta">By <strong>Rusiru</strong> • August 03, 2025</p>

    <p>It all started with a simple question: <em>“How does a website really work?”</em> That question quickly turned into a rabbit hole of curiosity — and that rabbit hole led me directly to the world of cybersecurity.</p>

    <p>In high school, I remember stumbling across a video of someone performing a SQL injection. It looked like magic — but it was also terrifying. The idea that someone could manipulate a website just by changing the URL blew my mind. I wasn't sure if I wanted to be a good hacker or a bad one, but I knew I wanted to understand how it all worked.</p>

    <h2>From Curiosity to Action</h2>
    <p>I started playing around with Linux, setting up virtual machines, and poking around in systems I didn’t fully understand. I broke a lot of things. But I learned even more. Soon after, I discovered Capture The Flag (CTF) platforms like TryHackMe and Hack The Box. That’s when things really clicked for me.</p>

    <p>There’s a thrill in discovering a vulnerability — even in a simulated environment. The feeling of solving a challenge that’s part logic, part detective work, and part technical prowess is addictive. I knew this wasn’t just a hobby. It was a calling.</p>

    <h2>Building a Purpose</h2>
    <p>Today, I see cybersecurity as more than just cool tools and exploits. It’s about protecting people. It’s about making the digital world a safer place. Whether it's helping organizations secure their infrastructure or educating others on best practices, my goal is to make a positive impact.</p>

    <p>Cybersecurity is a field that’s always evolving — and that’s what makes it beautiful. You’re never done learning. There’s always a new technique, a new exploit, a new tool. It keeps you on your toes. It forces you to grow.</p>

    <p>And that’s why I’m here.</p>
